Hi, I'm Matt

This is my software engineering journey. You can find most of the things I was working on and how I developed my software engineering skills.
I will be slowly updating it to include all my personal and professional work and experience. 


# Year 1998

It was exciting time writing software using Assembler and Pascal for DOS. Now it is only the history.

## Debugging and software modifications in DOS

This is not something to be proud of. I cracked the software that allowed me to learn touch typing. 
The software was free and offered all the features with the caveat that the unregistered version had a splash screen. 

You need about ten minutes of your time and clicking space key before you can start using it. 
I used Turbo Debugger for DOS and figured out how to skip the splash screen. 

Like in many cases it is a simple NOP over the splash screen call.
The challenge was that the code of the software is compressed/encrypted. 
You cannot make the change permanently to MASZ.EXE binaries.

This assembler code is acting as debugger and is doing exactly what I was doing manually with Turbo Debugger:
- Load MASZ.EXE into memory without executing it.
- Set break point after the code is decompressed/decrypted.
- Execute the program and let it decompress/decrypt the code.
- The break point calls the trace and trap procedures to find the code address in memory.
- Apply NOP slide over the call to the splash screen.
- Continue execution of modified code.

You can find the code in my [8086](https://github.com/Jandini/8086) repository under [CRACK](https://github.com/Jandini/8086/tree/main/CRACK)
